this is a game that we did as a small project for informatic class, the code needs otpimisations and english rewriting, i'll get to it at some point
***
howeverthe game is playable, in case of bugs between stages you may want to restart it at the end of the levels (qwick fix, you can just move the balls initialisation)<br>
*you'll need processing >3.4 to play it correctly*
